     Work Experience 

     I worked as a tech assistant for BlogJam on October 2019, 19th  to October 2019, 20th  BlogJam Dartmouth, 
     NS I made sure their software was running effectively and people knew how to use it ahead of time before their presentation, 
     I was told by the co-heads of the organization I was more effective than previous years volunteers and that 
     I had done an amazing job during the event. I was effectively able to save them 500.00$ in being easily available and 
     quick to pick up information.
