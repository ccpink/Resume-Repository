During this project I had to create a base AI for both the zombies 
and the humans and define their movement patterns as well as deal 
with the internal memory in deleting the zombies and humans when 
one had died, It was difficult to deal with multiple
vectors containing the zombies and humans. It pushed in my second 
year semester one because of how many parts I had to deal with.
It was an engaging assignment and overall it was fun.
